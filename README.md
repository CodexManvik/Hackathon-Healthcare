# Hackathon-Healthcare

This is a readme file for the project made on the 20th of July 2024, by the team bugcode.exe

The team did a project that used machine learning models to analyze user data and provide personalized wellness recommendations based on their lifestyle, diet, and activity levels.

It is used as a health monitoring system which is cost-effective and more portable. 

The world is moving to make most things automated and AI-driven and so have there changes in the healthcare system, our project wants to emphasize that and provide just a gist of what AI can do if used properly in the healthcare field. 

Please note that Training data and API key has not been mentioned while submitting a 'skeleton' code.
